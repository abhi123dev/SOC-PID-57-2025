# 🧠 Week 6 – Intro to Backend Development ⚙️

Welcome to **Week 6** of the Trackathon journey!

This week marked a major shift in focus from frontend design to **backend development** — the core that powers data handling, business logic, and server-side operations for modern web applications.

## 🚀 What I Learned

I focused on building a solid foundation in backend technologies that form the backbone of full-stack development:

### 🔧 Technologies Covered

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment that enables server-side logic.
- **Express.js**: Lightweight framework for creating robust APIs and web applications.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL document-oriented database for fast, flexible data storage.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library that adds structure to MongoDB with schemas.

## 📺 Learning Resources

I explored the following curated video tutorials and took detailed handwritten notes to deepen my understanding:

1. **Backend Development Crash Course** – Sheryians Coding School  
2. **Node.js Crash Course**  
3. **MongoDB Crash Course** – Bro Code  
4. **Mongoose Crash Course** – Web Dev Simplified  
5. **Express.js Explained** – Web Dev Simplified  
6. **Build a REST API with Node, Express & MongoDB** – Web Dev Simplified  

These resources covered concepts like:
- Setting up a Node.js project
- Creating API routes using Express
- Performing CRUD operations with MongoDB
- Defining schemas and models with Mongoose
- Structuring RESTful APIs

## 📚 Documentation I Referred To

To go beyond the tutorials, I consulted official documentation for deeper clarity:

- [Node.js Docs](https://nodejs.org/en/docs)
- [Express.js Docs](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB Docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/)
- [Mongoose Docs](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/)

Reading the docs helped solidify my conceptual understanding and filled gaps that videos sometimes skip.
